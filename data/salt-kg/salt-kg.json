You can specify a shipping condition in the customer master and in the vendor master.  Shipping point determination (outbound delivery):  The loading group , the plant and the shipping condition determine the shipping point that will be proposed by the system.  Route determination (outbound delivery):  Apart from the country and the geographical region of the shipping point, the ship-to party and the transportation group , the shipping condition determines the route that the system proposes in the order for the delivery of the goods. In the delivery, the route proposal also takes the weight group into account.  ### Example  A particular customer always requires immediate delivery. You enter the appropriate shipping condition into the customer master record. This means that when you process orders for this customer, the system automatically proposes the express mail room as a shipping point and the quickest way to the airport as a route.  ### Procedure  If a shipping condition has been assigned to a sales document type in Customizing, this condition will be proposed by the system in the corresponding sales document. If there is no assignment, the system copies the relevant data from the corresponding customer master record of the sold-to party. You cannot change this value during delivery processing. The shipping condition will not be copied from the delivery into the shipment. The shipping condition is one of several criteria for selecting deliveries when you create a shipment. You can enter a shipping condition manually in the shipment where it only serves as a characteristic for grouping shipments.",

You can specify a shipping condition in the customer master and in the vendor master.  Shipping point determination (outbound delivery):  The loading group , the plant and the shipping condition determine the shipping point that will be proposed by the system.  Route determination (outbound delivery):  Apart from the country and the geographical region of the shipping point, the ship-to party and the transportation group , the shipping condition determines the route that the system proposes in the order for the delivery of the goods. In the delivery, the route proposal also takes the weight group into account.  ### Example  A particular customer always requires immediate delivery. You enter the appropriate shipping condition into the customer master record. This means that when you process orders for this customer, the system automatically proposes the express mail room as a shipping point and the quickest way to the airport as a route.  ### Procedure  If a shipping condition has been assigned to a sales document type in Customizing, this condition will be proposed by the system in the corresponding sales document. If there is no assignment, the system copies the relevant data from the corresponding customer master record of the sold-to party. You cannot change this value during delivery processing. The shipping condition will not be copied from the delivery into the shipment. The shipping condition is one of several criteria for selecting deliveries when you create a shipment. You can enter a shipping condition manually in the shipment where it only serves as a characteristic for grouping shipments.",

You can specify a shipping condition in the customer master and in the vendor master.  Shipping point determination (outbound delivery):  The loading group , the plant and the shipping condition determine the shipping point that will be proposed by the system.  Route determination (outbound delivery):  Apart from the country and the geographical region of the shipping point, the ship-to party and the transportation group , the shipping condition determines the route that the system proposes in the order for the delivery of the goods. In the delivery, the route proposal also takes the weight group into account.  ### Example  A particular customer always requires immediate delivery. You enter the appropriate shipping condition into the customer master record. This means that when you process orders for this customer, the system automatically proposes the express mail room as a shipping point and the quickest way to the airport as a route.  ### Procedure  If a shipping condition has been assigned to a sales document type in Customizing, this condition will be proposed by the system in the corresponding sales document. If there is no assignment, the system copies the relevant data from the corresponding customer master record of the sold-to party. You cannot change this value during delivery processing. The shipping condition will not be copied from the delivery into the shipment. The shipping condition is one of several criteria for selecting deliveries when you create a shipment.

' ': Not relevant for billing  You can use this category to prevent items from being included in billing.  Item categories KLN (free item) and TAE (explanation) are set up with billing relevance ' ' in the standard system.  A: Relevant for delivery-related billing  Billing is based on the outbound delivery. The billing status is only updated in the outbound delivery.  B: Relevant for order-related billing  Billing is based on the sales document. The billing status depends on the requested delivery quantity.  Item categories REN (returns) and BVN (cash sales items) are set up with billing relevance B in the standard system.  C: Relevant for order-related billing  Billing is based on the sales document. The billing status depends on the target quantity.  Item categories G2N (credit memo) and L2N (debit memo) are set up with billing relevance C in the standard system.  D: Relevant for pro forma  To create a pro forma invoice, the billing relevance indicator must not be blank. Indicator D is also used as follows for cross-company-code business processing: If there are free-of-charge outbound deliveries, the company code that is responsible for the delivery should be granted an internal settlement. You can use indicator D to enable this for free-of-charge deliveries.  F: Relevant for order-related billing - Status based on invoice receipt quantity  Relevant for order-related billing based on the invoice receipt quantity (third-party business transaction). The system does not transfer the order to the billing due list until the vendor invoice has been received and processed in the purchasing department. After the receipt of each invoice, a customer invoice is created for the quantity that appears on the vendor invoice. The order has status \"Billed\" until the next vendor invoice is received.  Item category TAS (third-party business) is set up with billing relevance F in the standard system.  This process can also be related to the goods receipt quantity. You can make the control setting as to whether the invoice receipt quantity or the goods receipt quantity is relevant for billing in the copy control for billing on the item level in the Billing Quantity field.
